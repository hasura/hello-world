# Hasura Hello World

This quickstart will take you over Hasura's instant backend APIs (BaaS) and how to deploy your custom code too.

## Clone & deploy

Any project on hasura.io/hub can be cloned and deployed. In fact, this hello-world is a hasura project itself.

**Step 1:** Install the hasura CLI: [installation instructions](https://docs.hasura.io/0.15/manual/install-hasura-cli.html)

**Step 2:** Create a hasura project on your machine

```
$ # 1) Run the quickstart command
$ hasura quickstart hasura/hello-world
```

**Step 3:** Deploy the project to your free cluster!

```
$ # 2) Git add, commit & push to deploy to your cluster
$ cd hello-world
$ git add . && git commit -m 'First commit'
$ git push hasura master
```

**Note**: Your free cluster got automatically created when you ran the `quickstart` command.

### What got 'deployed'?

This hello-world project contains a sample data schema and some sample data (files in `migrations`). When you ran the `git push` these tables got created.

In the next few steps you'll be browsing the instant Hasura APIs and exploring adding custom microservice too.

## Data APIs / GraphQL

The Hasura Data API provides ready-to-use GraphQL APIs and also an HTTP/JSON API backed by a PostgreSQL database.

These APIs are designed to be used by any client capable of making HTTP requests, especially
and are carefully optimized for performance. It also supports role-based access control to handle permissions at a row and column level.

 The URL to be used to make the GraphQL queries will be `https://data.cluster-name.hasura-app.io/v1alpha1/graphql`.

As mentioned earlier, this quickstart app comes with two pre-created tables `author` and `article`.

![article-author-schema](https://filestore.hasura.io/v1/file/d5262259-282f-4b8a-b214-13e4d860b966)

Alternatively, you can also view the schema for these tables on the api-console by heading over to the tab named `Data`.

### Using the API console

The hasura CLI gives you a web UI to manage your data modeling, manage your app users and explore the Hasura APIs.
The API explorer gives you a collection of all the Hasura APIs and lets you test them easily.

Access the **api-console** via the following command:

```
$ hasura api-console
```

This will open up Console UI on the browser. You can access it at [http://localhost:9695](http://localhost:9695)

* You can create tables using the api-console. Access it at [http://localhost:9695/data/schema/table/add](http://localhost:9695/data/schema/table/add)


![create table api-console](https://filestore.hasura.io/v1/file/fa421020-d241-4dc9-b0c2-b3cf64838da9)


Let's look at a sample query to explore the Data APIs:

### GraphQL Operations
GraphQL Operations are supported by Hasura Data APIs.

* `Query`: Select all entries in the article table, ordered by desc rating:
```graphql

query fetch_article {
  article (order_by: ["-rating"]) {
    id
    title
    content
    rating
    author_id
  }
}

```

The above query can be made on the api-console to test out responses.

![create table api-console](https://filestore.hasura.io/v1/file/517b66e4-a332-4c4e-9a41-573e84f6e8b1)

* `Mutation`: Update author table where id is 111 and set name as "yoha".
```graphql
mutation update_author {
  update_author(where: {id: {_eq: 111}} _set: {name: "yoha"}) {
    affected_rows
    returning {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

For more examples of GraphQL queries, check out the [docs](https://docs.hasura.io/0.15/manual/data/graphql.html)

### Relationships

The data APIs lets you define relationships based on these foreign key constraints. Read more about it [here](https://docs.hasura.io/0.15/manual/data/relationships.html)

### Permissions

The permission layer of the data APIs lets you define row level and column level access control policies for various roles. Read more about it [here](https://docs.hasura.io/0.15/manual/data/permissions.html)

## Auth APIs

Every app almost always requires some form of authentication. This is useful to identify a user and provide some sort of personalized experience to the user. Hasura provides various types of authentication (username/password, mobile/otp, email/password, Google, Facebook etc).

### Signup
Let's look at an example of simple username/password signup.

* Signup using username and password:
POST `auth.cluster-name.hasura-app.io/v1/signup` HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
```json
{
  "provider" : "username",
  "data" : {
     "username": "johnsmith",
     "password": "somepass123"
  }
}
```

Typical response of a signup request looks like:
```json
{
  "auth_token": "b4b345f980ai4acua671ac7r1c37f285f8f62e29f5090306",
  "username": "johnsmith",
  "hasura_id": 2,
  "hasura_roles": [
      "user"
  ]
}
```

Once a user is registered (or signed-up) on Hasura, it attaches a Hasura Identity or (hasura_id) to every user. A Hasura identity is an integer. You can use this value in your application to tie your application’s user to this identity.

To learn more, check out our [docs](https://docs.hasura.io/0.15/manual/users/index.html)

### Add instant authentication via Hasura’s web UI kit

Every project comes with an Authentication kit, you can restrict the access to your app to specific user roles.
It comes with a UI for Signup and Login pages out of the box, which takes care of user registration and signing in.

![Auth UI](https://docs.hasura.io/0.15/_images/uikit-dark.png)

Follow the [Authorization docs](https://docs.hasura.io/0.15/manual/users/uikit.html) to add Authentication kit to your app.

## File APIs

Sometimes, you would want to upload some files to the cloud. This can range from a profile pic for your user or images for things listed on your app. You can securely add, remove, manage, update files such as pictures, videos, documents using the Hasura filestore.

This is done via simple POST, GET and DELETE requests on a single endpoint.

Just like the Data service, the File API supports Role based access control to the files, along with custom authorization hooks. (Check out our [ documentation ](https://docs.hasura.io/0.15/manual/filestore/index.html) for more!)

### Uploading files

Uploading a file requires you to generate a file_id and make a post request with the content of the file in the request body and the correct mime type as the content-type header.

```http
POST https://filestore.cluster-name.hasura-app.io/v1/file/05c40f1e-cdaf-4e29-8976-38c899 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: image/png
Authorization: Bearer <token>

<content-of-file-as-body>
```

This is a very simple to use system, and lets you directly add an Upload button on your frontend, without spending time setting up the backend.

### Downloading files
Downloading a file requires the unique file id that was used to upload it. This can be stored in the database and retrieved for download.

To download a particular file, what is required is a simple GET query.
```http
GET https://filestore.cluster-name.hasura-app.io/v1/file/05c40f1e-cdaf-4e29-8976-38c899 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Add your own custom microservice

Let's say you want to add a microservice. You can choose one that's already present in another Hub project, you can make use of `hasura clone`. You can quickly add a Node.js microservice by running the following:

```bash
$ hasura microservice clone api --from hasura/hello-nodejs-express
```

This will clone the api microservice from hello-nodejs-express project available on Hub.

You can add a microservice using your own Dockerfile and source-code. Check out [docs](https://docs.hasura.io/0.15/manual/microservices/add-microservice/using-custom-dockerfile.html) to know how to create the same.

Once you have added a new service, you need to add a route to access the service.

### Add the ​route for the service created.

```bash
$ hasura conf generate-route <service-name> >> conf/routes.yaml
```

It will generate the route configuration for the service and append it to `conf/routes.yaml`.

### Add a remote for the service (Only for git push based services)

```bash
$ hasura conf generate-remote <service-name> >> conf/ci.yaml
```

This will append the remotes configuration to the conf/ci.yaml file under the {{ cluster.name }} key.

### Apply your changes

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Added a new service"
$ git push hasura master
```
